    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a 4th year ITM students with a specialzation in Software Development and a
        a minor in Software Engineering. This will be my final year here at IIT before 
        I intend to join the work force. I plan the stay here in Chicago after I graduate. 
        The only thing that would realistically get me to move would be some extremely high 
        paying job at a reputable company.
